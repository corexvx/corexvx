I'm a Business Computing student interested in media, design, and technology.


🎬 I work with **DaVinci Resolve** for video editing — from cinematic sequences to short-form content.  
🖼️ I use tools like **Photoshop** and **Illustrator** for graphic design, and I'm currently exploring **game development** with Unity.  
🎮 I enjoy learning through building projects and experimenting with creative tools.
